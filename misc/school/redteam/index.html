				<h1>Societal Problem</h1>
					The current class enrollment system is insufficient for handling course overflows.  This results in excess student communication with faculty in order to facilitate the student's desire to be enrolled in a specific course.  While the student and faculty body are attempting to resolve this issue, they are taken away from their other tasks.  Implementing a wait list feature to the current working course add/drop system will greatly reduce the number of these avoidable communications.

				<h1>Identify the Customer(s)</h1>
					There are two "customers" that this solution will benefit.  One, of course, is the student body.  This tool will take out the initial "panic factor" when a course has reached capacity.  The other half of the customer base will be the faculty.  Staff will receive some relief from the influx of emails, phone calls, and personal visits that relate to course availability.

				<h1>A Perfect Solution</h1>
					A possible perfect solution would be thus: Implement a wait list for Computer Science courses with x number of spots (with x to be determined). A student who wishes to register for a closed course will add their name, UIN, email, phone number, and the section/sections of the course for which they wish to register to the wait list program. If a spot opens up in a closed course, the program will start with the first person on the wait list and move down the list until a match for both course number and course section is found. If no match is found on the wait list, nothing happens. If, however, a match is found, the student is sent an email and possibly a text message alerting them that a spot has opened up in their desired course and section. If the student registers for said course section in a given amount of time - let's just say six hours - their name is popped off of the wait list, everyone below them moves up a spot, and the student is sent an email letting them know they're no longer on the wait list. If the student fails to register for the course in the given amount of time, they are still popped off the list and sent an email alerting them that they are no longer on the wait list. But now the program will rescan the list for a course number and section match. The program will continue cycling through the students in this manner until either the wait list is empty or registration is closed, whichever comes first.
