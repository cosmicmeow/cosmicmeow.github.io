    <!-- WHAT IS VINYLMINT -->

    <div class="wrapper" style="background-color:#F0F0F0">
      <div class="mainpage">
      <h2 style="color:#333">What is Vinylmint?</h2> <br>
        <p>Vinylmint is the world’s leading <u>sound design contest</u> marketplace, powered by a massive community of sound designers and business owners. Small businesses and startups everywhere use our service to get musicians for  sounds, voiceovers and translations. Designers from all over the globe compete with their peers in sound design contests  to win prizes, improve their skills, and establish relationships with new clients. Here are some of the reasons why our customers love running sound design contests at Vinylmint:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Sound design contests are ideal for clients who don’t already have a freelance or in-house musicians.</b> Contests allow clients to see work from, and work with, many different musicians at once.</li>

            <li><b>Sound design contests let clients see finished designs custom-made for their company</b>, rather than committing to work with a musician based on their past work for other companies.</li>

            <li><b>Sound design contests are quick.</b> The average contest lasts for one week, at the end of which time the client walks away with a finished sound that’s ready to use. The musicians have great new sounds to add to their folios—and, if they’ve done well, some prize money too. </li>

            <li><b>Sound design contests are very cost-effective.</b> The client chooses the contest prize they want to pay, and know that designers will create designs for that price — there’s no going over budget here! </li>

            <li>If clients aren’t satisfied with the designs submitted to their contests, we offer a <u>100% money-back guarantee.</u></li>

          </ul>
          <br>

      <h2 style="color:#333">How long do design contests take, and what’s involved?</h2><br>

        <p>For all design categories, the contest will run for 1-7 days. Each contest runs in 4 stages:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Qualifying round</b>: The first 4 days of the contest are the Qualifying round. During this stage, the contest is open to all musicians, and listed on our contest listings page. Musicians submit designs, and the contest holder gives them feedback about what they like, and what they don’t. This is the musicians chance to show off their skills, and the contest holder’s chance to see how responsive designers are to their feedback.</li>

            <li><b>Select finalists</b>: At the end of the Qualifying round, the contest holder has 4 days to select up to 6 musicians to move into the Final round of the contest. Once this step is complete, the contest will become guaranteed, which means the contest holder will no longer be able to ask for a refund on it.</li>

            <li><b>Final round</b>: The Final round lasts from anywhere to 10 hours to 3 days depending on the urgency of the production. During this round, the contest holder works closely with muscians to help them revise the designs to perfection.</li>

            <li><b>Sound design contests are very cost-effective.</b> The client chooses the contest prize they want to pay, and know that designers will create designs for that price — there’s no going over budget here! </li>

            <li><b>Select winner</b>: After the Final round ends, the contest holder has up to 2 weeks to review the submitted designs and select a winner.</li>

    <!-- WHAT IS SOUND DESIGN?? -->
    <a id="sounddesign"></a>
    <div class="wrapper" style="background-color:#F0F0F0">
      <div class="mainpage">
      <h2 style="color:#333">What is sound design?</h2> <br>
        <p>A design contest is a competition between designers to create the winning sound design for a client’s design brief. 
        <br><br>
        Here on Vinylmint, clients are called contest holders. A contest holder:
        <ol>
          <li>Writes a design brief</li>
          <li>Names the contest’s cash prize</li>
          <li>Starts their contest.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        The contest has <u>four stages, and lasts around 1-7 days</u>.<br><br>
        Subscribed Vinylmint musicians from around the world see the contest listing in the <u>Vinylmint marketplace</u>. They compete for the prize by submitting designs that meet the brief.<br><br>
        The contest holder <u>gives feedback and direction</u> to the musicians to help them improve on their sound designs through two rounds of competition.<br><br>
        Finally, the contest holder <u>picks a winner</u>. The winning musician receives the prize money, and the contest holder gets the sound design files, and <u>full copyright to the winning design</u>.

    <!-- HOW MANYYY -->
    <a id="choosehowmany"></a>
    <div class="wrapper" style="background-color:#94D3ED">
      <div class="mainpage">
      <h2 style="color:#333">How many sound designs will I get to choose from?</h2><br>
      <p>
        That depends on how you handle your contest. <br><br>

        We provide a rough guide to how many designs you’re likely to get as part of <u>the launch process</u> — just select a category, click <b>Continue to Pricing</b>, and you’ll see a rough guide to the number of entries you’re likely to see depending on whether you’re offering a Bronze, Silver, or Gold prize amount.<br><br>

        But there are no guarantees about how many designs you’ll get. The number of designs will depend a lot upon you. Here’s a few tips for increasing the number of entries in your design contest:
        <ul>
          <li>Increase the prize amount you offer to designers.</li>
          <li>Provide a very clear brief.</li>
          <li>Provide feedback and interact with designers.</li>
          <li>Guarantee the prize for your contest.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- WHO OWNS WHAT AND WHEN-->
    <a id="whoownswhat"></a>
    <div class="wrapper" style="background-color:#F0F0F0">
      <div class="mainpage">
      <h2 style="color:#333">Who owns what and when?</h2> <br>
        <p>
          On Vinylmint, designers agree to upload only original sounds, so each musician owns the rights to their design submissions.<br><br>
          This is true until the contest holder chooses one of the designs as the contest’s winner. Then, and only then, can the designer agree to <u>transfer his or her rights to that particular sound</u> to the contest holder.<br><br>
          The musician transfers their rights in the Sound Design Handover stage, and once it’s done, the contest holder becomes owner of the rights to that sound.<br><br>
          If a musician creates several sound concepts for one contest, but the contest holder only buys one of them, then all the unused sound concepts remain the property of the musician, but will automatically be deposited into a sound marketplace for transactions that pay the artist directly. The contest holder can, of course, negotiate with the musician for the transfer of rights to more than one of their sounds.<br><br>
          If the contest holder does not buy a musician’s work, it remains the property of the musician.

    <!-- COPYRIGHT HANDLING -->
    <a id="copyright"></a>
    <div class="wrapper" style="background-color:#C0D580">
      <div class="mainpage">
      <h2 style="color:#333">How is copyright handled?</h2><br>
      <p>
        Each musician owns the copyright to their sounds until they are declared a contest winner by a contest holder, and transfer the rights over the winning sound to the contest holder. <br><br>

        That transfer happens at the end of the contest, in the <u>Sound Design Handover stage</u>. <br><br>

        This gives both parties a chance to sign the Sound Design Transfer Agreement.<br><br>

        After the winning sound has been uploaded in the Sound Design Handover process, and the copyright transfer is agreed to by both parties, copyright is seen to be transferred to the contest holder.<br><br>

        You can print the Sound Design Transfer Agreement for your records if you wish. <br><br>

        But we’ll also keep a copy of the agreement on our site, where you can access it at any time through your Sound Design Handover page.<br><br>

        <a href="">View the Design Transfer Agreement here</a>.
